# WebAppName-A6Styleguide

<!-- Custom Web App Logo  -->
create a vector based logo using Adobe Illustrator. In addition, youâ€™ll need to create logo variations depending on usage. Groups are strongly encouraged to create a logo with both a logo mark (symbol) and the logo type (text) with any combination of colour. You should consider sizing
options (what different sizes might your logo appear in your web app) and clearspace (minimum spacing around the logo)
- Logo in black and white
- Logo in greyscale
- Logo in full colour
- Horizontal version of full colour logo
- Stacked/vertical vertical version of full colour logo
    - Include a short logo description:
    - Describe the selection of logo mark and logotype you used and why you felt they work together.
    - What do the shapes and logo font style mean to communicate to your audience?
    - What key design principles were you working towards?



<!-- Colour Palette -->
Using a colour scheme generator select a colour palette(s) that you plan on using throughout your web app. Use one of the exported palettes (as a PNG) and insert as an image into your styleguide.
- Make sure that the colour palette includes all the hexidecimal codes of all the colours.
- Describe briefly your choice of colour palette and what makes you connect to the colour meanings or theme of those colours.
- Provide visual examples of how the colours are to be used throughout the web app such as:
    - background colours,
    - menu colours,
    - button colours
    - colours in different sections of your site



<!-- Typography -->
In this section, you'll want to format the text with CSS and cover all the headers h1- h6, paragraphs, links (both normal and rollover), text that appears in navigation menus, side bars, quotations, forms, lists, tables etc. You'll need to know what typeface you are using for those and show a sample on the page.
- Use Google Fonts
- Maximum 3 different font faces with multiple styles
- Create samples for relevant items such as H1-H6, paragraphs, links, etc.
- Be very clear how your different fonts are being used throughout the web app: consider showing sizes, colour and style information for each font used.
- Provide a quick explanation as to why you went with those fonts, what do you like about the style and how do you think this connects well with the web app you are creating
- Ensure that the Google Fonts are properly linked to the servers rather than needing to be downloaded directly to the computers.



<!-- Imagery/Icons -->
As you'll notice in a lot of different branding styleguides, there's a unique style in the graphics, imagery and icons that are used. You'll want to show the style of imagery and icons that you plan on using. You may use inserted images and/or embed directly the Font Awesome icons or other icon sources
- Include a couple of images
- Include a few icons not just only for social media, but for infographic purposes
- Don't forget that imagery may also include things such as borders (colour/width/style, drop shadows, rounded corners, captions etc. that would also need to be described more rather than just showing an image
- Show sizing of common sized images appearing throughout your web app
- Add links to the sites where you'll be referencing the imagery and icons as well
